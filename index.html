    <h1>My Website!</h1>
    

        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Kaleb Badgett. I am a student at Texas Tech University majoring in Computer Engineering.
        Through my time at Tech, I have learned many things such as, how to use Verilog, C++, Python (basic understanding), building breadboard circuits using combinational and sequential logic, 
        and most important of all, how to learn! As I learn more, and undergo more projects, I will update this page with the results.<br><br>
        My time at Tech has been very educational and I am very excited to put what I learn here to use in the workplace. 
        Feel free to check out my projects below!
        </p>

            <h3>CPU Project</h3>
                <p>The project I am most proud of is my final project from my Modern Digital Systems class with Professor Derek Johnston.               The goal of this project was to create a fully function CPU using breadboards and different digital logic devices. My group 
                    and I faced many challenges, such as malfunctioning breadboards and faulty wiring, while completing this project, but the
                   end result was exactly what we wanted. We were able to build a fully functional CPU that is comprised of a acting ROM in
                   the form of an Arduino, registers, multiplexers, hex inverters, programmable logic devices, and an AND gate. Our CPU
                   functions just as a normal CPU would, only it is on a smaller scale. It is a 4-bit CPU that has 2 registers and can preform
                   4 opperations: addition, subtraction, exclusive OR, and move.
                   <br> <br>
                   Below, you will find pictures displaying our CPU and some of our work regarding our machine code as well as some videos of the CPU in action!
                   In addition to this, if you would like to view the project report my team put together as well as some examples of our arduino code, you can download the PDF here <span>&#8594;</span>  <a href="/CPU_Stuff/CPU Project Report.pdf" download="Project_Report">Project Report</a>.
                </p>
            <h4>First, Let's Look as the CPU Diagram</h4>
            <p>This hardware diagram shows the different components of the CPU and how they all interact with each other.</p>
            <img class = visual src="images/CPU Diagram.png" alt="Picture of the CPU Diagram">
            <p><br></p>

            <h4>Second, Take a Look at the CPU</h4>
            <p>The CPU is comprised of two multiplexers and two hex inverters on the top two boards. The next chips on the board are the two programmable logic devices,
            or PLDs. Directly below those are the two registers. To their left is an AND gate and one final hex inverter.</p>
            <img class = visual src="images/CPU Hardware.JPG" alt="Picture of the CPU">
            <p><br></p>
            <h4>Next, Let's Look at Some of Our Machine Code Calculations</h4>
            <p>Below, you will see three photos of machine code and binary multiplication calculations. We used this data to complete our multiplication algorithm
               that was then put into the arduino.</p>

            <p><br></p>
            



            <h4>Now for the Demonstration</h4>
            <p>Below, you will find a video that observes the CPU as it runs through a multiplication algorithm.</p>
            <div class="iframe">
            <iframe

            </iframe> 
            </div>
              <p><br></p>
            <h4>Next, Take a Look at the XOR Function in Action</h4>
            <p>An exclusive OR, or XOR, function is one in which if the inputs are the same, the output is zero, and if the inputs are different, the output is one.
            View this for yourself in the as the CPU preforms this function!</p>

            </div>
              <p><br></p>
              <h4>This Final Video Was For Fun More Than Anything Else</h4>
              <p>In this video, we changed our clock cycle from 1 second to 1 millisecond. This causes our CPU to run almost too fast to see. Even in the slomotion capture toward
             the end of the video, the calculation occurs extremely quickly.</p>

    <h2>C++ Programming Projects</h2>
    <h3>Traffic Lights Using an Arduino</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>In my first programming project, I completed models a simple RC circuit. It takes in user inputs for time and calculates current
        and voltage based off that. You can find the project report with code included <a href="/PDF files/ECE 2305 - Programming Project 01.pdf" download="Project_Report">here</a>.</li><br>
    <li>The second project was to create a program that could solve the quadratic formula. It takes user inputs for a, b, and c and a series of if 
        else statements that control the output depending on how the inputs influence the equation.

        by the user. You can find the project report with code included <a href="/PDF files/ECE 2305 - Programming Project 8.pdf" download="Project_Report">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>Programming Project 9 was to create a program that could encode and decode different messages based on ASCII values
        and output the new messages in .txt values. This was completed by using switch case functions and for loops.
        You can find the project report with code included <a href="/PDF files/ECE 2305 - Programming Project 9.pdf" download="Project_Report">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>The tenth and final programming project was to use classes, overloaded operators, and object oriented programming to complete different 
        operations on complex numbers. You can find the project report with code included <a href="/PDF files/ECE 2305 - Programming Project 10.pdf" download="Project_Report">here</a>.
