    <h1>My Website!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Kaleb Badgett. I am a student at Texas Tech University majoring in Computer Engineering. <br>
        Through my time at Tech, I have learned many things such as, how to use Verilog, C++, Python (basic understanding), building breadboard circuits using<br> combinational and sequential logic, 
        and most important of all, how to learn! As I learn more, and undergo more projects, I will update this page with the results!<br><br>
        My time at Tech has been very educational and I am very excited to put what I learn here to use in the workplace! <br>
        Feel free to check out my projects below!
        </p>
        <h2>The Crown Jewel! My First Video Game!</h2>
        
        <p>The first thing on my list of projects is my very own "build your own adventure" game called (insert name here). <br>
            In this game, the player is able to choose between a science fiction or fantasy setting. After this, the game begins!
        </p>
        
        <p>In this prompt based games, you will be presented with many choices and every coice you make will have an effect moving forward.<br>
            It may be something as simple as which weapon you choose, what characters you interact with, or even which doors you leave closed<br>
            but it will have an effect all the same. Will you be the hero who saves the world? Or will you be the villain bent on domination? <br>
            It is all up to you in (insert name here)! So, will you venture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU&t=1808s" target="_blank">where no man has gone before?</a>
            Or, will you choose to explore the world of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU&t=1808s" target="_blank">magic</a>?
            <br><br>
