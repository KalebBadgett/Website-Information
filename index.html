    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    <div id="About"></div>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my page! Here, you can learn a little about me and view my personal and school related projects.
            My name is Kaleb Badgett and I am a sophomore currently attending Texas Tech University in
            pursuit of a degree in Computer Engineering. I am from Odessa, Texas and have lived there for
            the last twelve years. I have interests in drumming, computers, hardware systems,
            novelty board games, and sharing my faith. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends,
            and playing tabletop board games.
            <br><br>
        Through my time at Tech, I have learned many things such as, how to use Verilog, C++, Python (basic understanding), building breadboard circuits using combinational and sequential logic, 
        and most important of all, how to learn! As I learn more and undergo more projects, I will update this page with the results.<br><br>
        My time at Tech has been very educational, and I am very excited to put what I learn here to use in the workplace. 
        Feel free to check out my projects below!

        <h2>ECE Award</h2>
        <p>
            In my freshman year at Texas Tech, I was awarded the ECE Freshman of the Year Award, as shown in the photo. To read more

            <h3>CPU Project</h3>
                <p>The project I am most proud of is my final project from my Modern Digital Systems class with Professor Derek Johnston. 
                    The goal of this project was to create a fully functional CPU using breadboards and different digital logic devices. My group 
                    and I faced many challenges, such as malfunctioning breadboards and faulty wiring, while completing this project, but the
                   end result was exactly what we wanted. We were able to build a fully functional CPU that is comprised of an acting ROM in
                   the form of an Arduino, registers, multiplexers, hex inverters, programmable logic devices, and an AND gate. Our CPU
                   functions just as a normal CPU would, only it is on a smaller scale. It is a 4-bit CPU that has 2 registers and can preform
                   4 opperations: addition, subtraction, exclusive OR, and move.
                   <br> <br>
                   Below, you will find pictures displaying our CPU and some of our work regarding our machine code as well as some videos of the CPU in action!
                   In addition to this, if you would like to view the project report my team put together as well as some examples of our arduino code, you can download the PDF here <span>&#8594;</span>  <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99hlZ08qbyHi9OMDS?e=e4eRcZ" target="_blank">Project Report</a>.

                <div id="CPUDiagram"></div>
            <h4>First, Let's Look as the CPU Diagram</h4>
            <p>This hardware diagram shows the different components of the CPU and how they all interact with each other.</p>
            <img class = visual src="images/CPU Diagram.png" alt="Picture of the CPU Diagram">
            <p><br></p>
            <div id="CPU"></div>
            <h4>Second, Take a Look at the CPU</h4>
            <p>The CPU is comprised of two multiplexers and two hex inverters on the top two boards. The next chips on the board are the two programmable logic devices,
            or PLDs. Directly below those are the two registers. To their left is an AND gate and one final hex inverter.</p>
            <img class = visual src="images/CPU Hardware.JPG" alt="Picture of the CPU">
            <p><br></p>
            <div id="MachineCode"></div>
            <h4>Next, Let's Look at Some of Our Machine Code Calculations</h4>
            <p>Below, you will see three photos of machine code and binary multiplication calculations. We used this data to complete our multiplication algorithm
               that was then put into the arduino.</p>

            <p><br></p>
            <div id="Demonstration"></div>
            <h4>Now for the Demonstration</h4>
            <p>Below, you will find a video that observes the CPU as it runs through a multiplication algorithm.</p>
            <div class="iframe">
            <iframe 
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ORW4xQazzq8">

            </div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="XOR"></div>
            <h4>Next, Take a Look at the XOR Function in Action</h4>
            <p>An exclusive OR, or XOR, function is one in which if the inputs are the same, the output is zero, and if the inputs are different, the output is one.
            View this for yourself in the video as the CPU preforms this function!</p>

              <p><br></p>
              <div id="1M"></div>
              <h4>This Final Video Was For Fun More Than Anything Else</h4>
              <p>In this video, we changed our clock cycle from 1 second to 1 millisecond. This causes our CPU to run almost too fast to see. Even in the slomotion capture toward
             the end of the video, the calculation occurs extremely quickly.</p>

            <div id="C++"></div>
    <h2>C++ Programming Projects</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In my first programming project, I created a model of a simple RC circuit. It takes in user inputs for time and calculates current
        and voltage based off that. You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99Vwv7XjHDYSAuX1t?e=LgbiOA" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><br>
    <li>The second project was to create a program that could solve the quadratic formula. It takes user inputs for a, b, and c and a series of If 
        Else statements that control the output depending on how the inputs influence the equation.
        You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99WU4pReL5_pC2xut?e=KoPR5i" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>

        for <span class="pi">&#8508;</span>. You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99Wpw9aoKSpLoZO3j?e=231hGD" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>The fourth programming project was to use Loops and Switches to preform different calculations on complex numbers. You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK95wVc7DpM6o_42Uc1?e=BpuT5y" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>My fifth project was to create different User Defined Functions that would preform different actions on a 1-D array. 
        Some of these actions include finding the largest and smallest values, finding the mean, finding the median, and finding the mode.
        You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK95wb0MR7O5kyJnyqC?e=LcvmPc" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>Programming Project 6 was to create a program that could convert numbers from hexadecimal to decimal and from decimal to hexadecimal. 
        In this project, I had to create Loops and such that could convert the string value of the hex numbers to usable integers and 
        compare ASCII values to complete the conversion process. You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK95wQyV4GdOP24cdJq?e=hK8jAw" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>In the seventh programming project, I had to create two .txt files. One would contain a sorted list of randomly generated 
        numbers and the other contained a histogram of the results. You can find the project report with code and .txt outputs included 
        <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99XbpYdO1D2af9Pmy?e=hzMRwF" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>The eighth project was to create a series of For Loops to complete a Gaussian Elimination based on coefficient values given 
        by the user. You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99gdUq5TxbnyEX1l_?e=oUEf7O" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>Programming Project nine was to create a program that could encode and decode different messages based on ASCII values
        and output the new messages in .txt values. This was completed by using Switch Case functions and for Loops.
        You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99g25ZaaTdGQlJgEM?e=4fCCq3" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li><br>
    <li>The tenth and final programming project was to use Classes, Overloaded Operators, and Object Oriented Programming to complete different 
        operations on complex numbers. You can find the project report with code included <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmoEu1oAVGK99he01WatzPhpOsS4?e=AMoJBy" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h2>Bonus Project!</h2>
    <p>One project that has yet to be mentioned is the very website you are reading from! To build this website, I used online resources, 
        and the knowledge of a couple of friends to teach myself how to use HTML and CSS. Through this, I was able to style this website 
        in order to make it responsive. This is what allows the website to shift and change depending on the screen size. I made it this 
        way so that the website would be viewable on computers and phones. To make it responsive, I split the website into a twelve section
        grid. With each section controlling a different sections of the webpage, it changes with the size of the screen. This is only one of
        the many styling choices I am using. If you would like to see the HTML and CSS code used for this website, you can view it on my 
        GitHub <a href="https://github.com/KalebBadgett/Website-Information" target="_blank">here</a>.
