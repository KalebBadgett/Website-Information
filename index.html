        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Kaleb Badgett. I am a student at Texas Tech University majoring in Computer Engineering. <br>
        Through my time at Tech, I have learned many things such as, how to use Verilog, C++, Python (basic understanding), building breadboard circuits using<br> combinational and sequential logic, 
        and most important of all, how to learn! As I learn more, and undergo more projects, I will update this page with the results.<br><br>
        My time at Tech has been very educational and I am very excited to put what I learn here to use in the workplace. <br>
        Feel free to check out my projects below!

            <h3>CPU Project</h3>
                <p>The project I am most proud of is my final project from my Modern Digital Systems class with Professor Derek Johnston.<br>
                   The goal of this project was to create a fully function CPU using breadboards and different digital logic devices. My group <br> 
                   and I faced many challenges, such as malfunctioning breadboards and faulty wiring, while completing this project, but the<br> 
                   end result was exactly what we wanted. We were able to build a fully functional CPU that is comprised of a acting ROM in <br>
                   the form of an Arduino, registers, multiplexers, hex inverters, programmable logic devices, and an AND gate. Our CPU <br>
                   functions just as a normal CPU would, only it is on a smaller scale. It is a 4-bit CPU that has 2 registers and can preform <br>
                   4 opperations: addition, subtraction, exclusive OR, and move.
                   <br> <br>
                   Below, you will find pictures displaying our CPU and some of our work regarding our machine code as well as some videos of the CPU in action!<br>
                   In addition to this, if you would like to view the project report my team put together, you can download the PDF here <span>&#8594;</span>  <a href="/CPU_Stuff/CPU Project Report.pdf" download="Project_Report">Project Report</a>.

            <h4>First, Let's Look as the CPU Diagram</h4>
            <p>This hardware diagram shows the different components of the CPU and how they all interact with each other.</p>
            <img class = visual src="images/CPU Diagram.png" alt="Picture of the CPU Diagram">
            <p><br></p>

            <h4>Second, Take a Look at the CPU</h4>
            <p>The CPU is comprised of two multiplexers and two hex inverters on the top two boards. The next chips on the board are the two programmable logic devices, <br>
            or PLDs. Directly below those are the two registers. To their left is an AND gate and one final hex inverter.</p>
            <img class = visual src="images/CPU Hardware.JPG" alt="Picture of the CPU">
            <p><br></p>
            <h4>Next, Let's Look at Some of Our Machine Code Calculations</h4>
            <p>Below, you will see three photos of machine code and binary multiplication calculations. We used this data to complete our multiplication algorithm<br>
               that was then put into the arduino.</p>

            <h4>Now for the Demonstration</h4>
            <p>Below, you will find a video that observes the CPU as it runs through a multiplication algorithm.</p>

            </iframe> 
              <p><br></p>
            <h4>Next, Take a Look at the XOR Function in Action</h4>
            <p>An exclusive OR, or XOR, function is one in which if the inputs are the same, the output is zero, and if the inputs are different, the output is one.<br>
            View this for yourself in the as the CPU preforms this function!</p>

              <p><br></p>
              <h4>This Final Video Was For Fun More Than Anything Else</h4>
              <p>In this video, we changed our clock cycle from 1 second to 1 millisecond. This causes our CPU to run almost too fast to see. Even in the slomotion capture toward<br>
             the end of the video, the calculation occurs extremely quickly.</p>

        <h3>My First Video Game!</h3>
        
        <p>Next on my list of projects is my very own "build your own adventure" game called Defending Nallapas. <br>
            In this Science Fiction based game, you will make a series of choices that will have an affect on your future.
        </p>
        
        <p>In this prompt based games, you will be presented with many choices and every coice you make will have an effect moving forward.<br>
            It may be something as simple as who you talk to, How you react to a situation, or even the words you choose to use<br>
            but it will have an effect all the same. Will you be the hero who saves the galaxy? Or will you be the villain bent on domination? <br>
            It is all up to you in Defending Nallapas! Are you ready to venture <a href="https://github.com/KalebBadgett/Defending-Nallapas/tree/main" target="_blank">where no man has gone before?</a>
            <br>
            <p>I built this game using C++. With 970 lines of code and 15 seperate endings, every choice you make carries weight!</p>
